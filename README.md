# MAGD150-ASSIGNMENTS

For [lab 08] (https://github.com/tenncor/MAGD150-ASSIGNMENTS/tree/gh-pages/f18_magd150_lab08_Tenner), the code shows a inspirational message with a little man waving at the bottom.

For [lab 05] (https://github.com/tenncor/MAGD150-ASSIGNMENTS/tree/gh-pages/f18magd150lab05_Tenner), there shows two buttons. When one button is clicked the person looks normal but when the
other one is clicked it looks like an alternate reality.

For [lab 06] (https://github.com/tenncor/MAGD150-ASSIGNMENTS/tree/gh-pages/f18magdlab150lab06_Tenner), a nice autumn day is pictured to show weather.

For [lab 02] (https://github.com/tenncor/MAGD150-ASSIGNMENTS/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab02_Tenner.pde), there are three balloons shown in various shapes and sizes.

Then finally for [lab 03] (https://github.com/tenncor/MAGD150-ASSIGNMENTS/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab03_Tenner.pde), the code is written for a screensaver. There is a ball that bounces around the screen and depending on where the mouse is changes the background color.
